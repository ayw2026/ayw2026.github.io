## Hexaly Social Event -- February 11, 2026, 17:00 -- 19:30

On Wednesday late afternoon, we took a guided tour of [Palazzo Bo](https://www.unipd.it/en/visitbo), the historic heart of the University of Padua. The cultural event was kindly sponsored by [Hexaly](https://www.hexaly.com).

## Sponsor Sessions -- February 12-13, 2026, 14:00 -- 14:30

As in previous editions of the AIROYoung Workshop, there were short presentations by some companies and entities supporting the event. They presented their activities, tools, and applications in the fields of Operations Research and Optimization.

### Hexaly, Julien Darlay, Co-Founder & Head of Science

**Title**: Hexaly, Hybrid Optimization Solver <br/> 
 **Abstract**: Hexaly is an innovative hybrid optimization solver based on a nonlinear, set-based modeling formalism. This formalism unifies and extends modeling paradigms from mixed-integer linear programming, nonlinear programming, constraint programming, and black-box optimization. Internally, Hexaly integrates a broad range of exact and heuristic optimization techniques, including branch-and-bound, column and cut generation, constraint propagation, and local search, among others. From a computational standpoint, Hexaly demonstrates competitive performance with state-of-the-art solvers such as Gurobi, CPLEX, and OR-Tools, delivering efficient and scalable solutions to routing, scheduling, packing, clustering, and location problems. This presentation introduces the set-based modeling formalism and demonstrates its scalability for solving large-scale problems. It further examines how the solver exploits this formalism to automatically orchestrate advanced exact and heuristic solution methods drawn from the current state of the art.

### Mosek ApS, Gustaf Ehn, Head of Sales

**Title**: Conic optimization for system building <br/> 
**Abstract**: In applications, optimization is embedded in a system performing a higher-level task, for example, workforce scheduling, trajectory optimization in robotics, etc. In this talk, we are going to highlight the strengths and usability of conic optimization in building applied optimization systems.

### Italian National Research Council, Institute for System Analysis and Computer Science “Antonio Ruberti”, Marco Boresta, Postdoctoral Researcher

**Title**: Operations Research at IASI–CNR: Methods, Challenges, and Real-World Applications <br/>
**Abstract**: The National Research Council of Italy (CNR) is the largest public research organization in the country. With more than 80 research institutes and approximately 6,000 researchers, CNR aims at producing new scientific knowledge, fostering technology transfer, and promoting research dissemination. This presentation focuses on the research activities carried out at the Institute for Systems Analysis and Computer Science (IASI–CNR), with particular emphasis on the Optima research group, whose work spans multiple Operations Research topics and integrates Artificial Intelligence methods for both research and technology transfer. After outlining the main research areas and methodological challenges addressed at IASI—ranging from optimization under uncertainty to sustainability and fairness-driven decision models—the talk illustrates some examples on how these approaches are applied to real-world problems. 

### Italian National Research Council, Institute for Applied Computing, Serena Fugaro, Senior Post-doc and Technology Transfer Officer

**Title**: Mathematical and Computational Methods for Interdisciplinary Science <br/>
**Abstract**: The increasing complexity of modern scientific and technological challenges demands an integrated approach combining mathematical modelling, advanced algorithms and high-performance computing. Mathematics plays a central role in the design of efficient, scalable, and robust solution strategies, far from being merely a descriptive language. The Institute for Applied Computing (IAC) “Mauro Picone” of the National Research Council (CNR) conducts interdisciplinary research to develop mathematical, statistical and computational methods for significant scientific, social and industrial problems. Its activities span a wide range of application domains, including engineering, medicine, biology, environmental sciences, economics and finance, information and communication technologies, and cultural heritage. As a concrete example, the presentation will focus on the “Sportello Matematico per l’Innovazione e le Imprese” (Mathematical Desk for Innovation and Industries) project, which is aimed at fostering collaboration between research and industry through technology transfer and networking activities.

## ⁠AIROYoung Roundtable  -- February 12, 2026, 17:20 -- 18:30

As part of the milestone 10th anniversary edition of the AIROYoung Workshop, we held a special roundtable featuring the founding members of AIROYoung, as well as the members of the previous AIROYoung boards (on-site or remotely).
This session offered insights into the origins of the AIROYoung chapter, its growth over the years, and the vision for its future. Nonetheless, we discussed about what being early-career researchers means and the relevance of building one's own network.

## ⁠Social dinner -- February 12, 2026, 20:00 -- 23:00

On Thursday evening, the social dinner took place at [Osteria Antico Brolo](https://www.anticobrolo.it), located in the city center of Padua, at [Corso Milano 22](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ZVD6ayTuZ9x41RbX6).
Aperitifs and after-dinner drinks were offered by [Distilleria Brunello](https://www.brunello.it/it/), the oldest Italian artisan distillery.
