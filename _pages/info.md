## Registration

AIROYoung's mission is to involve everyone in its events, regardless of their funds. For this reason, our events are free for everyone, and we work hard to secure some funding to help with accommodation.

Participants submitting an abstract and simple attendees are required to fill in the Workshop Registration Form. Link to the form will be available soon.

## Accommodation grants

Thanks to the financial support offered by AIRO and our sponsors, we are able to provide several **accomodation grants** to cover accommodation expenses for the entire event. Grants will be awarded on a first-come, first-served basis to participants who indicate their interest in applying for the grant during the registration process and are AIRO members. Note that you are already an AIRO member if you have registered for The International Conference on Optimization and Decision Science (ODS) 2025 or if you have paid the AIRO registration fee for the year 2026.

Grants availability:

- 12/10 grants for those who present, regardless of their career stage.
- 4 grants for those who do not present, but must be masterâ€™s students or first-year Ph.D. students (in this case, a certificate from a supervisor is required to confirm this).

If you have further questions, you can send an email to `airoyoungworkshop2026@gmail.com` and `airo.young.researchers@gmail.com`.
