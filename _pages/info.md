## Registration

AIROYoung's mission is to involve everyone in its events, regardless of their funds. For this reason, our events are free for everyone, and we work hard to secure some funding to help with accommodation.

Participants submitting an abstract and simple attendees are required to fill in the Workshop Registration Form. Link to the form will be available soon.

## Accommodation grants

Thanks to the financial support offered by AIRO and our sponsors, we are able to provide several **accommodation grants** to cover accommodation expenses for the entire event (i.e., hotel check-in on February 8, Sunday afternoon, and check-out on February 13, Friday morning)

Grants availability:

- 12 grants for those who, regardless of their career stage, submit an abstract to hold a presentation and whose abstract is accepted.
- 4 grants for those who do not submit an abstract, but must be masterâ€™s or first-year Ph.D. students (in this case, a certificate from a supervisor is required to confirm this).

Participants who will be awarded an accommodation grant will receive a notification by December 23, 2025, with all the instructions to follow to confirm the grant.

If you have further questions, you can send an email to `airoyoungworkshop2026@gmail.com` and `airo.young.researchers@gmail.com`.
