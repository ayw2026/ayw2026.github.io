**Short bio**: Martine Labbé is an honorary professor at the Université Libre de Bruxelles. She was a full professor from 2000 to 2019 and was president of EURO between 2007 and 2008. She has contributed substantially to various topics, including bilevel optimization, network optimization, location problems, routing, and machine learning. In 2019, she was the first female researcher to receive the EURO Gold Medal, the highest distinction in our field in Europe.

**Title**: Solving Chance-Constrained (mixed integer) Linear Optimization Problems with Branch-and Cut <br/> 
**Abstract**: We consider chance-constrained optimization problems (CCOPs), where constraints with random coefficients must hold with probability above a given threshold. Such problems arise frequently in energy applications and are NP-hard. In the linear case with random data of finite support, CCOPs can be reformulated as mixed-integer linear programs using big-M constants.
We propose a Branch-and-Cut algorithm for linear CCOPs, introducing new valid inequalities and analyzing their closures. Theoretical and computational results demonstrate the strength of these inequalities compared to existing ones, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

This is a joint work with Diego Cattaruzza, Matteo Petris, Marius Roland and Martin Schmidt.

**Title**: Vehicle Routing Problems <br/> 
**Abstract**: Vehicle routing problems (VRPs) form a central class of optimization problems in operations research, with many practical applications. This talk provides a tutorial-style overview of key VRP variants and reviews state-of-the-art exact and heuristic solution techniques. We then highlight several problem extensions that have attracted significant research interest in recent years, driven by new application domains. The talk concludes with a forward-looking discussion of emerging research directions in vehicle routing, with particular emphasis on the integration of machine learning into routing algorithms.

**Title**: Large-Scale and Data-Driven Markov Decision Processes <br/> 
**Abstract**: 
Markov decision processes (MDPs) constitute one of the predominant modeling and solution paradigms for dynamic decision problems affected by uncertainty. MDPs model the dynamics of a system through a random state evolution that generates rewards over time. The decision maker aims to select actions that influence this state evolution so as to maximize rewards. In this talk, we review recent advances in MDPs along two directions: (i) the construction of data-driven policies that combine the (traditionally separated) tasks of estimating the system’s behavior and selecting actions that maximize rewards in the estimated system, and (ii) the exploitation of structure to solve large-scale problems. In view of (i), we will show how the consideration of data-driven policies naturally leads to the study of robust MDPs, where the decision maker combats overfitting by hedging against the worst system dynamics that are plausible under some given training data. We will also discuss how alternative models of robustness offer different trade-offs between the competing goals of out-of-sample performance and complexity of the involved policies and computations. As for (ii), we will review two types of structure that allow us to alleviate the well-known curse of dimensionality: weakly coupled MDPs that combine a potentially large number of MDPs via a small number of linking constraints, and factored MDPs whose states are represented by assignments of values to state variables that evolve and contribute to the system's rewards largely independently.

**Title**: Partitioning a Graph into Connected Components <br/> 
**Abstract**: In this talk, we study problems that involve partitioning the vertices of an undirected graph into a given number of pairwise disjoint sets such that each set induces a connected subgraph. We first propose valid inequalities, which extend and generalize the ones in the literature, and report on computational experiments demonstrating their use (joint work with P. Moura and R. Leus). Then, we extend this problem to also compute a spanning tree for each set of the partition such that the weight of the heaviest tree is minimized. We investigate the complexity of this problem and present formulations and solution methods, which we compare with an experimental study (joint work with M. Davari and P. Moura). Finally, we consider a practical problem encountered in power system restoration, which involves partitioning a power network into connected subnetworks, one for each black start generator, such that the restoration time is minimized. We propose a solution method that uses a new formulation and properties of optimal solutions and report computational results (joint work with H. Çalık and D. Van Hertem).
