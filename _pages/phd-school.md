**Short bio**: Domenico Salvagnin is an Associate Professor of Operations Research at the Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua. He earned his Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics (Operations Research) from the same university in 2009. His research focuses on linear and mixed-integer programming, constraint programming, and hybrid optimization methods. He has received several international awards, including the DIMACS Implementation Challenge (2014) and best paper prizes at CPAIOR 2019 and ICAPS 2019. He has collaborated with IBM ILOG CPLEX and FICO XPRESS and serves as Technical Editor for Mathematical Programming Computation.

**Title**: Computational Research 101
**Abstract**: In this talk we discuss the joy and pain of computational research. We start from basic principles on experimental design, continue with tips and pitfalls in data analysis, and finally argue why software engineering best practices are relevant even in the context of academic research. We conclude with a few comments on how (not) to present empirical results.
