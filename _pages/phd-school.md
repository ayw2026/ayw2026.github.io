**Short bio**: Matteo Fischetti is full professor of Operations Research at the University of Padua, Italy. He is Associate Editor of the journals “Operations Research” (till 2024) and “Mathematical Programming Computation”. He won the "Best PhD Dissertation on Transportation” prize awarded by ORSA (1987) and the INFORMS Edelman award (2008). In 2015, he won the Harold Larnder Prize awarded by the Canadian Operational Research Society. His research interests include Integer Programming, Combinatorial Optimization, Railway Optimization, Vehicle and Crew Scheduling Problems. Matteo Fischetti published more than 130 papers on top-level international journals of the field; his H-index on Google Scholar is 73.

**Title**: Benders and Bilevel Optimization

**Abstract**: In this introductory talk, I will address Benders decomposition methods, and I will present some basic solution methods for Mixed-Integer Bilevel optimization. The talk is intended for Ph.D. students who are not working on these problems, but want to know more about them.

**Short bio**: Domenico Salvagnin is an Associate Professor of Operations Research at the Department of Information Engineering, University of Padua. He earned his Ph.D. in Computational Mathematics (Operations Research) from the same university in 2009. His research focuses on linear and mixed-integer programming, constraint programming, and hybrid optimization methods. He has received several international awards, including the DIMACS Implementation Challenge (2014) and best paper prizes at CPAIOR 2019 and ICAPS 2019. He has collaborated with IBM ILOG CPLEX and FICO XPRESS and serves as Technical Editor for Mathematical Programming Computation.

**Title**: Computational Research 101

**Abstract**: In this talk we discuss the joy and pain of computational research. We start from basic principles on experimental design, continue with tips and pitfalls in data analysis, and finally argue why software engineering best practices are relevant even in the context of academic research. We conclude with a few comments on how (not) to present empirical results.
